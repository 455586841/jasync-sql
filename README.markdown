# postgresql-netty - an async Netty/NIO based PostgreSQL driver written in Scala

The main goal of this project is to implement a performant and fully functional async PostgreSQL driver. This project
has no interest in JDBC, it's supposed to be a clean room implementation for people interested in talking directly
to PostgreSQL.
